# 👋 Hi, I'm Ryan

I'm a **Web Developer & Designer** and **IT Technician** with a focus on building modern, responsive websites and solving real-world technical problems. On the IT side, I work with tools like **Azure**, manage **virtual machines**, handle **helpdesk support**, and troubleshoot **networked hardware**—skills that complement my programming work and projects.

I enjoy creating clean, functional solutions—whether that's a static site for a business or a multithreaded OS simulator.
